			<!-- Definition will be linked to Kevin's page at a current spot-->
			<h2> <a href = "Definitions.html"> Definition </a> </h2>
			<p> We took off the case first, uncovering the computer's internal hardware.</p>

			<h1 id = "power"> Step 2 : Removing the Power supply Unit </h1>
			<h2> <a href = "Definitions.html"> Definition </a> </h2>
			<p> Next, we removed the power supply, as it was the most accessible part of the unit to remove.</p>
			<img src = "Images/PowerSup1.jpg" height = "400" width = "400" alt = "Picture of the power supply before it was removed">

			<h1 id = "fan"> Step 3 : Pull the Cooling Fan out </h1>
			<h2> <a href = "Definitions.html"> Definition </a> </h2>
			<p> We then pulled the cooling fan out, revealing the CPU underneath it.</p>
			<img src = "Images/Fan1.jpg" height = "400" width = "400" alt = "Pic. of Fan sitting on top of the CPU">
			<img src = "Images/Fan2.jpg" height = "400" width = "400" alt = "Pic. of exposed CPU after fan was removed">
			<img src = "Images/Fan3.jpg" height = "400" width = "400" alt = "Picture of the inside of the fan">
			
   	 	        <h1 id = "cpu"> Step 4 : Extracting the CPU </h1>
			<h2> <a href = "Definitions.html"> Definition </a> </h2>
			<p> After removing the fan that was covering the CPU, we carefully extracted the CPU (a.k.a. Central Processing Unit)</p>
			<img src = "Images/CPU1.jpg" height = "400" width = "400" alt = "Picture of the CPU while still inside the case">
			
        	        <h1 id = "bios"> Step 5 : Detach the BIOS/ROM </h1>
			<h2> <a href = "Definitions.html"> Definition </a> </h2>
			<p> The BIOS stored inside a ROM chip was the next to be removed from the main unit. </p>
			<img src = "Images/BIOS1.jpg" height = "400" width = "400" alt = "Picture of the BIOS removed from the motherboard">
			
      		        <h1 id = "ram"> Step 6 : Examining the RAM </h1>
			<h2> <a href = "Definitions.html"> Definition </a> </h2>
			<p> Right after removing the ROM chip, we took the RAM out of the unit as well. </p>
			<img src = "Images/RAM1.jpg" height = "400" width = "400" alt = "Picture of the front of the RAM">
			<img src = "Images/RAM2.jpg" height = "400" width = "400" alt = "Picture of the back of the RAM">
			
      		        <h1 id = "disk"> Step 7 : Eject the Disk Drives </h1>
			<h2> <a href = "Definitions.html"> Definition </a> </h2>
                        <p> Now, we pressed on the green snap-on/snap-off clips to remove both the floppy disk drive and the CD-ROM drive. </p>
			<img src = "Images/DiskDrive1.jpg" height = "400" width = "400" alt = "Picture of the disk drives slotted behing the hard disk drive">
			<img src = "Images/DiskDrive2.jpg" height = "400" width = "400" alt = "Picture of the floppy disk drive">
			<img src = "Images/DiskDrive3.jpg" height = "400" width = "400" alt = "Picture of the CD-ROM disk drive">
			<img src = "Images/DiskDrive4.jpg" height = "400" width = "400" alt = "Picture of the CD-ROM disk drive's plastic strips">
			
			<h1 id = "mother"> Step 8 : Lift the Motherboard out </h1>
			<h2> <a href = "Definitions.html"> Definition </a> </h2>
                        <p> With all the important parts of the computer removed that were located on the motherboard, we decided to lift the motherboard out of the base of the unit.</p>
			<img src = "Images/Motherboard1.jpg" height = "400" width = "400" alt = "The motherboard held by a student">
			<img src = "Images/Motherboard2.jpg" height = "400" width = "400" alt = "Another picture of the motherboard">
			
			<h1 id = "hard"> Step 9 : "Rip out" the Hard disk drive </h1>
			<h2> <a href = "Definitions.html"> Definition </a> </h2>
                        <p> Finally, we took out the hard disk drive which proved to be a challege because it was covered with layers of metal and the angle at which we needed to pull the hard drive out of the case was right against the side of the unit. </p>
			<img src = "Images/HardDisk1.jpg" height = "400" width = "400" alt = "Picture of hard drive inside the case">
			<img src = "Images/HardDisk2.jpg" height = "400" width = "400" alt = "Picture of student removing the hard drive by unscrewing some screws">
			<img src = "Images/HardDisk3.jpg" height = "400" width = "400" alt = "Picture of hard drive removed">
			
			<h1 id = "graphics"> Step X : Graphics and Audio </h1>
			<h2> <a href = "Definitions.html"> Definition </a> </h2>
			<p> There were probably also graphics/video and audio cards located somewhere inside the unit which we could not find.</p>
			
			<h1> Finish! </h1>
			<p> Pictures of our completed disassembling of the computer unit: </p>
			<img src = "Images/Finished1.jpg" height = "400" width = "400" alt = "Picture of a disassembled computer unit">
