			<h1 id = "case"> Step 1 : Cracking the Case (System Unit) </h1>
			<!-- Definition will be linked to Kevin's page at a current spot-->
			<h2> Definition </h2>
			<p> We took off the case first, uncovering the computer's internal hardware.</p>
			<!-- Images here -->
			<h1 id = "power"> Step 2 : Removing the Power supply Unit </h1>
			<p> Next, we removed the power supply, as it was the most accessible part of the unit to remove.</p>
			
			<h1 id = "fan"> Step 3 : Pull the Cooling Fan out </h1>
			<p> We then pulled the cooling fan out, revealing the CPU underneath it.</p>
			
   	 	        <h1 id = "cpu"> Step 4 : Extracting the CPU </h1>
			<p> After removing the fan that was covering the CPU, we carefully extracted the CPU (a.k.a. Central Processing Unit)</p>
			
        	        <h1 id = "bios"> Step 5 : Detach the BIOS/ROM </h1>
			<p> The BIOS stored inside a ROM chip was the next to be removed from the main unit. </p>
			
      		        <h1 id = "ram"> Step 6 : Examining the RAM </h1>
			<p> Right after removing the ROM chip, we took the RAM out of the unit as well. </p>
			
      		        <h1 id = "disk"> Step 7 : Eject the Disk Drives </h1>
                        <p> Now, we pressed on the green snap-on/snap-off clips to remove both the floppy disk drive and the CD-ROM drive. </p>
			
			<h1 id = "mother"> Step 8 : Lift the Motherboard out </h1>
                        <p> With all the important parts of the computer removed that were located on the motherboard, we decided to lift the motherboard out of the base of the unit.</p>
			
			<h1 id = "hard"> Step 9 : "Rip out" the Hard disk drive </h1>
                        <p> Finally, we took out the hard disk drive which proved to be a challege because it was covered with layers of metal and the angle at which we needed to pull the hard drive out of the case was right against the side of the unit. </p>
			
			<h1 id = "graphics"> Step X : Graphics and Audio </h1>
			<p> There were probably also graphics/video and audio cards located somewhere inside the unit which we could not find.</p>
